Examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shaming people for not meditating long enough<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shaming them for not having a vegan or &#8220;natural&#8221; diet<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not following the right guru or tradition<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Following some moral code like celibacy, or worse, having an active sex life<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest Spiritual Shamers, the ones who should win the Nobel Prize for Shaming, are of course the <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/fck-the-law-of-attraction\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26\">Law of Attraction<\/a> community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Secret&#8221; crowd will openly tell rape victims and people with cancer they &#8220;attracted&#8221; their suffering due to their &#8220;negative&#8221; thinking. Doesn&#8217;t get any more shamey than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to provide some alternative thinking patterns to counter all this shaming:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1 Longer and harder baby<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meditating more\/longer will not make you a &#8220;better&#8221; meditator or help you reach Nirvana sooner.

And I have a whole post on why meditating longer <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/no-meditating-longer-wont-get-you-enlightenment-sooner\/\">isn&#8217;t always a good idea.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2 What you put in your mouth<\/strong> <strong>or You-Know-Where<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you put in your mouth and\/or sex organs has no relation to how spiritual you are. Yes, some foods have a more spiritual vibration, but the field is very complex and not as simple as &#8220;Veggies good, meat bad.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We live in polluted cities full of angry people, and the vibrations of that will counter any good ones you get from eating apples all day long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So eat healthy, unprocessed food if you can afford it. And don&#8217;t be so judgemental towards other people&#8211; they have their own life\/choices and may not be able to afford to eat Avocado Kale salads every morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.
