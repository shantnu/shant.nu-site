I want a more meaningful job where I can make a difference to the world<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a subtle problem with this attitude I want to address in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s not your job \/ relationship \/ boss \/ parents jobs to give you meaning<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel empty and without meaning in your life, it is easy to blame external things: Your job sucks (and maybe it does), your boss is too demanding and doesn&#8217;t respect you, your relationship is going nowhere etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you cannot find joy or meaning or purpose outside of you. It&#8217;s not your job&#8217;s or your bosses job to give you purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds like a clich\u00e9, but you can only find your purpose inside of you and not in some external thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Illusion of External Fulfilment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While external things like jobs or relationships can bring us happiness sometimes, they are by their nature transient. It&#8217;s like trying to find stability on a boat&#8211; sure the boat may sometimes be stable and even enjoyable but ultimately it is  slave to the whims of the ocean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in a boat, you can get stability by never going deep into the ocean. And this is the path some people choose&#8211; they never take risks, stick to the same dead end job or relationship; and while they may avoid the storms of life they slowly die inside until they are nothing but a body with no soul.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This does not mean Money is &#8220;Evil&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing wrong with the material world and enjoying it. Some religions \/traditions try to denounce the world and wealth as evil and run from it, but I find that is just a way of avoidance, a form of <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/spiritual-bypassing-using-spirituality-to-hide-from-your-problems\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"39\">bypassing<\/a>. Like little children closing their eyes and pretending they are invisible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/omg-money-is-sooooo-unspiritual\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"322\">there is nothing wrong with wanting a better job, more money<\/a>, and (<em>dare I say it?<\/em>), more sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your inner worth, your sense of purpose, your inner contentment and peace <strong>cannot depend on it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must find your purpose\/joy <strong>inside. <\/strong>The outer world then is just a way to express that joy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is so important I must repeat it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your Joy\/Contentment\/Peace comes from inside.
