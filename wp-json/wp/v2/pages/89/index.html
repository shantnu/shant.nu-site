I don&#8217;t want to name names, as I&#8217;m sure the fault was mine for mis-reading or misunderstanding, but here&#8217;s a version of something I&#8217;ve read a million times:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You don&#8217;t have to worry about all these psychological issues as once you reach Samadhi\/Satori\/Zen they will all go away<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what we&#8217;ve been taught for at least 100 years, so it cannot be blamed on any new-age guru.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the last few years, we&#8217;ve started hearing a lot about <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/spiritual-bypassing-using-spirituality-to-hide-from-your-problems\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"39\">spiritual bypassing<\/a> (while the term was coined in the 1980s, I only came across is a few years ago; and if you visit any meditation forum you will find many people who still haven&#8217;t heard it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we were sold a block of bullshit that basically said, &#8220;Ignore your emotions, as all  this crap will go away anyway.&#8221; And it doesn&#8217;t help many teachers have been hostile to psychotherapy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many, I swallowed the blue pill and ignored my emotions, often meditating for hours a day. I used to laugh at the stupid people stuck in the material world. <em>&#8220;LOL Losers, I&#8217;ll be enlightened soon. You mofos won&#8217;t even recognise me. I won&#8217;t give you an autograph.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10\u201312 years passed. That&#8217;s when it started to sink in: <em>Maybe I&#8217;ll never get enlightened. And I will have to deal with this shit<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent the next 5\u20136 years as a hard core atheist, not believing in anything except what science could prove beyond 100% doubt. In a way, those years I spent in the spiritual desert were good as I had gathered a lot of stupid beliefs, everything from angel healing to psychics to talking to ghosts (see my post on <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/the-danger-of-magical-beliefs\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"120\">Magical Beliefs<\/a>). All those idiotic supernatural beliefs were holding me back materially and spiritually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t exaggerate when I use the words <strong>spiritual desert <\/strong>&#8211; Though I was gained control of my life and made some career progress, I felt spiritually deflated. It was only a HUGE spiritual experience in 2017 that brought me back to the path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even then, I hadn&#8217;t understood the concept of bypassing, so I kept hoping my pains would go away when I became enlightened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was only recently, while working with a coach who challenged my subconscious beliefs, did I come to realise: I&#8217;ve fucking turned the good old <em>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be happy when I&#8217;m a millionaire and\/or married to Gal Godot&#8221;<\/em> into <em>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be happy when I&#8217;m enlightened (and maybe married to Gal Godot)&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where enlightenment was a stage where there would be no suffering. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, in a type of <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/spiritual-materialism-my-chakras-are-more-open-than-yours\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"129\">Spiritual Materialism<\/a>, I stopped giving a hoot about the &#8220;<em>Now<\/em>&#8221; and started living in some future where I would be all enlightened and shit. And people would be like, <em>&#8220;OMG this Shantnu dude so enlightened, bro. He&#8217;s like the Kim Kardashian of enlightenment.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahem. Cough, cough. That&#8217;s when I realised my head was too far up somewhere no head should ever go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I wrote in my post on <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/toxic-positivity-or-why-happiness-isnt-always-a-good-thing\/\">Toxic Positivit<\/a>y, this constant quest for happiness is a recent new age phenomena. All the ancient seers, from Stoics to Buddhists to Yogis, all said the goal of life was to a) Live a life in service of others b) Live a life of balance and tranquillity. Quoting Oliver Burkeman:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>\u201cAnd here lies the essential difference between Stoicism and the modern-day \u2018cult of optimism.\u2019 For the Stoics, the ideal state of mind was tranquility, not the excitable cheer that positive thinkers usually seem to mean when they use the word, \u2018happiness.\u2019 And tranquility was to be achieved not by strenuously chasing after enjoyable experiences, but by cultivating a kind of calm indifference towards one\u2019s circumstances.\u201d<\/em><br>\u2015 Oliver Burkeman, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/work\/quotes\/19354514\">The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can\u2019t Stand Positive Thinking<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The hurry to get enlightened means we miss all the small things along the way, the things that stop us from full spiritual awakening in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This quest to get enlightened &#8220;NOW DAMMIT&#8221; is yet another tantrum by the childish ego trying to control the universe and fate. Ultimately, we are here to serve the Universe and its goals, and not teach some state of personal happiness while the rest of the world is suffering. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lonerwolf.com\/spiritual-materialism\/\">LonerWolf<\/a> call this an example of Spiritual Materialism:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>Practising meditation with the hidden agenda of trying to avoid suffering by becoming peaceful or detached all the time (when the reality is that thoughts and feelings are always fluctuating like the ebb and flow of the ocean \u2013 the point isn\u2019t to bypass or \u201ckill\u201d the mind, but to stop identifying with its contents).<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it is the belief that <em>if I just meditate enough,  I will never suffer again<\/em> that is so harmful. It&#8217;s just a form of escapism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Enlightenment &#8220;Finish&#8221; Line<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people treat enlightenment as a finish line:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-251\" width=\"345\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-2.png 613w, https:\/\/shant.nu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-2-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That is, you cross a line, and you are 100% certifiably enlightened. You get your gold medal and never have to feel shit ever again!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, that&#8217;s how many teachers\/traditions teach this, so I can understand the draw.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as a coach told me: If  we are embodied in human form, we will have to deal with all the problems of this  body and the material world it resides in. To pretend otherwise is a form of <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/spiritual-bypassing-using-spirituality-to-hide-from-your-problems\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"39\">spiritual bypassing<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the goal of spirituality becomes to live the best life we can, a life supported by the love of the universe, and in service of others. Rather than a selfish <em>Me! Me! Me! Why ain&#8217;t I enlightened, dammit?! ,<\/em> our goal should be to live by our goals and values (however we define them). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My advice today<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not focus on some &#8220;perfect&#8221; future state where you (and me) will be so enlightened and stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, focus on creating a life of equanimity and peace, a life not dependent on pleasures from external or future events, which includes enlightenment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And focus on being in service to others, on living your life to your own highest goals and values. Live a life you can be proud of, a life where you feel few or no regrets on your deathbed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about more <a href=\"https:\/\/shant.nu\/traps-on-the-spiritual-path\/\"><strong>Traps on the Spiritual Path<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9dbdac28-f937-454d-aa42-72d436f968bf\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-38c86222-6795-4cdb-8542-2f7f09e869b4\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had one HUGE spiritual block that caused me issue for years and was especially hard to get over.
