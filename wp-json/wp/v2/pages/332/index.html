Maybe not millions, but a little would help. Especially when the day job is going shit, and you know the fantasy that online entrepreneurs sell:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>Quit the day job! Start your own business! Don\u2019t depend on one person for all your income! Blah blah blah!

All you have to do is <em>(in thunderous manly voice)<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FOLLOW MY FORMULA!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His formula was, in a nutshell: Create training courses and sell them to others, just as he was doing. And at least one of us made big money (<em>hint, it wasn&#8217;t me<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My story<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I loved writing fiction&#8211; novels, short stories, interactive fiction. At first, I would just self-publish them on Amazon, no care whether anyone bought them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I joined a few writer groups, and they were all like \u201cYou need to market your work\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I spent hours every week building my email list, running ads, asking for reviews (as you need them to sell books), blogs\/podcasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found the type of fiction that sells is in a few mainstream genres, and in series (so you write a dozen books, all with a hard-boiled detective, for example). That&#8217;s why every book nowadays is in a series because publishers (traditional and indie)have figured out this is the \u201cformula\u201d to success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to experiment and play\u2014one genre I love writing is comedy-horror. This is one of those super niche genres that have a few hardcore fans but isn\u2019t mainstream. Think <em>Shaun of the Dead<\/em> in movies, or one of my favourite books <em>John Dies at the End.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other books I wrote were supernatural detective series, a fantasy comedy (a teddy bear that solves crime). Now, there are books like these and sell (and where do you think I got ideas from?), but they are not mainstream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to make the big money, you at least have to try writing for the \u201cmarket\u201d or trying to write in a way that appeals to the mainstream, or at least a large number of people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\u2019s what I did. Why not? Everyone else was doing it. They were pasting screenshots of how much money they were making online in Facebook groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while all the above I tried worked in the short term (and yes, it DOES work), soon I began to hate what I was doing and one day, I just couldn&#8217;t type anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one day, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Couldn\u2019t type one more word. Quit 2 years ago, after 7-8 years of writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have tried to restart many times, but each time, I feel disgusted and quit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trying to make money from your \u201cpassion\u201d is hard<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Just follow your passion and you won\u2019t have to work a day!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, if your passion is online marketing or making WordPress sites for cash-rich, time-poor business owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was writing, I hit all the clich\u00e9s about \u201cpassion\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I would be lost for hours in writing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I loved doing it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I did it for several years non-stop, including training to become better<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, in spite of my passionate &#8220;passion&#8221;, I never made enough money to quit the day job. I followed my passion and all it gave my was wrist pain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is a field where people make money\u2014 but like many other creative fields (music, sports, art), it\u2019s a winner-take-all field. 5-10% of authors make 90% of the money. And that\u2019s fine, I knew the statistics before I started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was still hoping to make some money. To be honest, I do, but it\u2019s never been more than a fancy night out each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never cracked the Amazon algorithm; I never got 10,000 fans on Facebook; I never got a huge email list of people <em>Oh gosh! Just waiting to buy my book.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in trying to hit these targets, I started hating what I was actually doing \u2014 writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My advice is<\/strong>: If you love someone, do it for love, don&#8217;t always try to make money from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all comes back to doing it for the love and accepting that perhaps this will always remain a hobby. Do it with a craftsman\u2019s mindset, always improving for the sake of improving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don\u2019t let anyone shame you if you don\u2019t want to make money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note: I wrote this post 2\u20133 years ago, and it had been sitting on my hard drive since then.<\/em> <em>I have given up fiction writing, though my books are still online I don&#8217;t do anything to promote them, nor am I writing new ones.
