It is the belief that collecting more things&#8211; money, house, sex, status etc will make us happy. Most people think this is the goal of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when we turn to spirituality, we bring this attitude to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly, it&#8217;s like, <em>If only I meditate more, I can become enlightened faster!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If only I buy these crystals\/go to that healer, my chakras will be opened quicker!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My guru is more enlightened than your guru!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Definition<\/strong>: Here is my best attempt:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Spiritual Materialism is pursuing meditation or spiritual practices to gain external rewards or status or personal gains, and not for inner growth and self transformation<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the 1st example above, about meditating more to become enlightened quicker, like meditation is some sort of god damn competition. I&#8217;ve seen many people boast how much they meditate (and slyly humiliate others&#8211; &#8220;<em>What, you only meditate 15 minutes daily? LOL that&#8217;s why you no enlightened, my man&#8221;<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This belief is so common that every meditation book \/ course assumes this&#8211;as well as every forum I&#8217;ve joined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Just meditate HARDER, bro! Work hard, play hard, meditate even fucking harder bro!
