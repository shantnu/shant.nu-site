The most egoistical (spiritually speaking) and angry people I\u2019ve seen and met are all <em>We need to save the world<\/em> types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always thought to myself: <em>Gee, you might want to save the world, but do you have to be such assholes about it?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why the Ego can&#8217;t Save the World, even though it totally wants to<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Question I know I will be asked: <em>Why are you trying to suggest we shouldn\u2019t save the world?

Yet, go to the poorest village in India or Africa, and you will find people happier than the millionaires in New York.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People suffer because of their addiction to thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inner Teacher says: <strong>90% of your problems would vanish if you could just shut up your mind for a few seconds, and rest in the Silence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One who has silences his own mind is better positioned to help heal others.
